Description: Elegant and Efficient Testing for PHP
 Codeception makes it ridiculously easy to manage the database 
 migrations for your PHP app. In less than 5 minutes you 
 can install Codeception and create your first database migration. 
 Codeception is just about migrations without all the bloat 
 of a database ORM system or framework.
